🐝:construction: 🐝  :construction:  🐝 :construction: 🐝This page is about the ***guidelines*** for any individual who interested contributing directly to the CloudKernelOS project.

First of all, it's important to familiarize yourself with the LARGER [collection of open source development communities](Communities.md) which are providing the foundation for the CloudKernelOS project ... you may want to direct your efforts to those [communities](Communities.md) and their issues and projects instead of this one.

*But, THANK YOU SO MUCH for your interest! Please check back in a week or so -- for now just* ... familiarize yourself with the [Mobyproject](https://mobyproject.org/) first and then [OSTree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/) and the general topics of [immutable operating systems](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/) and proto-OS layers for [layered image build systems](https://docs.pagure.org/releng/layered_image_build_service.html) which yield immutable, ultra-secure, more reliable, [monitorable operating systems](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22monitorability%22+%22operating+system%22&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=200) for container images.
