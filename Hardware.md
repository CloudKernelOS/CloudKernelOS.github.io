## Arduino vs Teensy vs et al

We might ask ["How would Arduino compare to a PJRC Teensy board using ROS 2 with real-time configurations?"](https://g.co/gemini/share/b9a19dfa07e3) OR [How does the PJRC Teensy board stack up against its competition, Arduino, et al?](https://g.co/gemini/share/ad57cf698fe6) In a nutshell the [PJRC Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) has the advantage in terms of technical specifications because of how the Teensy board will significantly outperform most Arduino boards in terms of raw processing power and clock speeds. This is particularly true if we are comparing a Teensy 3.x or 4.x with ARM Cortex-M processors to traditional AVR-based Arduino boards (Uno, Mega, etc.) ... but [the mix keeps changing](https://makezine.com/article/technology/boards-guide-2024-boards-are-back/) and there are boards like the [Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/giga-r1-wifi) which are touted as being the most powerful Arduino boards ever, so Arduino cannot be so easily dismissed.

So obviously, this is an evolving landscape ... there might indeed be better approach than [Arduino or Raspberry Pi and related ecosystems](https://intorobotics.com/most-dominant-single-board-computers-in-robotics/) or [PJRC Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/)  or [some other alternative platform](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-arduino-alternative-microcontrollers/) or [NVIDIA Orin AGX or NX](https://marketplace.nvidia.com/en-us/robotics-edge/) ... but **AFFORDABILITY** matters because of how it affects the size of the development community that can afford to participate ... obviously, the board has to have the technical specifications in order to be able to do relevant work with the ROS 2 or equivalent robotics middleware, so we are not talking about the bargain basement entry-level junior high science project boards, BUT swarms means experimenting with LOTS of units, so that might tend to rule out the $2000 development kit kinds of boards ... because *even if you have a $100K to throw at the project, you won't find a large community of developer who have your budget.*  In swarm robotics ... AFFORDABILITY is really about ***swarm***^*SQUARED*.

In other words, we do not really care about ONE team in isolation with an unlimited budget ... the CloudKernelOS is an OPEN SOURCE distributed development effort that demands **swarms** of *diverse* developers working on *diverse* development projects with **swarms** of units in *diverse* development communities with *diverse* applications ... it's not just about robotics or just another way to do edge computing ... the swarm robotics architecture of CloudKernelOS is also about mist computing, fog computing, dew computing, multi-agent networks, radio access networks ... in other words, it will take a lot of different, diverse, even divergent communities of developers to develop a robust ***emergent*** specification for the very ***swarmiest*** part of *swarm* robotics is the real-time, fault-tolerant swarm I/O for communication and distributed emergent intelligence of CloudKernelOS ... üêù*this will demand lots of hives of worker bees*üêù ... thus, ***provisioning*** those developer worker bees is what drives the **affordability** requirement for the hardware platforms used in development.
