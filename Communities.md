CloudKernelOS is a community-driven project that is BASED UPON different many open source development communities. 

In other words, the EXTENDED Community of CloudKernelOS, goes far, far, far beyond merely those individuals who are [Contributing](Contributing.md) to CloudKernelOS ... but we STRONGLY suggest participating in other open source development communities in order to learn something about **different** cultures based upon shared interests in particular facets of open source technology.
