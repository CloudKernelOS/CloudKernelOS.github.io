The CloudKernelOS is architecturally about the initial condensation of MIST.

🐝: CloudKernelOS is about [***pheromonic***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone) or [***neuromorphic*** computing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-021-00184-y) with evolving [***morphic***](https://www.nature.com/articles/427277b) or noisy [steganographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) communication akin to [electrochemically explorational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transport) 🍄 [fungal mycellium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium) or 🍄 [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha) found in 🍄 [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network) 🍄 for the [semiotic signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiotics) that might enabling [complex swarm behaviors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour) in [real-time operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system) of [loosely-networked distributed autonomous robotics](https://danielarus.csail.mit.edu/index.php/category/research/). 🐝

🐝Thus, we envision a RT/FT operation system whose I/O is designed to priortize and filter the noisy *pheromonic* signals of a swarm network. The processing of signals would rely on data affirmation and confidence assessment or weighted judgement of noisy signals coming from the [electrochemically explorational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_transport) [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha) found in 🍄 [mycorrhizal networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network) or swarms of coordinated noisy *buzzing* autonomous robotic units 🐝 to overcome the *wind* of other radio signals 📶 or weakness of any one single signal 📶 in a multiplexed communication fabric of highly faulty, tangled message threads, but the flip side of this is about the simplicity of durable intelligently-networked autonomous units. In some sense, it's is really about push for extreme simplification of real-time computing moving toward fault-tolerant computing, not just [beyond edge computing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/edge-computing/?ref=header_search) into [dew computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_computing), [off the edge and into the fog](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-edge-computing-and-fog-computing/?ref=header_search) and toward [fog computing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fog-computing/), toward [putting all of the computing power at the edge, for *mist*](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/how-cloud-fog-and-mist-computing-can-work-together/) and [multi-access computing and radio-access networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-access_edge_computing) for improving RELIABILITY, reducing fragility and building strength of the system through constantly-improving redundancy. 🏋️ 🐝
