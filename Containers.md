## The Role for Containers and K8s

Accreting the additional BASELAYERS of containers, ie not applications, but additional baselayer built on top of the foundational, ultra-minimalist primary baselayer will be fundamental for how the ephemeral CloudKernelOS layers on its functionality on top of an ultra-secure, ultra-minimalist PRIMARY base layer. 

A fork of K8s will be used to accomplish this accretion; tracing and observability will be essential to maintaining security and peformance.

🐝The general intention is about developing the the most extremely lightweight, **very most minimal baselayers** which would comprise a [monitorable]((https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22monitorability%22+%22operating+system%22&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=200)), secure :closed_lock_with_key: RTOS for ensuring [observeability](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/) :stethoscope: in safety-critical edgeOS or use cases such as :alembic: high performance computing or scientific computing :test_tube: for which an important set of threads :thread: completely dominate the :alembic: computing purposes :test_tube: of any use case for a container image.🐝
