# The Soil Environment

# [Selman Waksman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selman_Waksman)'s Seven Grand Questions on Soil Microbiology

[Selman Waksman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selman_Waksman), a biochemist and soil microbiologist whose research into the decomposition of organisms that live in soil, co-discovered [streptomycin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptomycin) along with [Albert Schatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Schatz_(scientist)) and [Elizabeth Bugie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bugie). Waksman's team in the Rutgers Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology. discovered several antibiotics, including actinomycin, clavacin, streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, neomycin, fradicin, candicidin, candidin. Streptomycin was the **first** effective drug against gram-negative bacteria and the first antibiotic used to cure tuberculosis. In 1952, Waksman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for "*ingenious, systematic, and successful studies of the soil microbes that led to the discovery of* ***streptomycin***." {NOTE: There are indeed controversies about exactly WHO deserves what share of the credit for the discovery of streptomycin, but there is NO controversy whatsoever that this work happened in Waksman's lab and that the members of lab developed and refined the procedures for the **ingenious, systematic, and successful studies of the soil microbes**.}

It is precisely that **ingenious, systematic, and successful studies of the soil microbes** that we are interested in carrying forward with Soil Quality Laboratory. Although Waksman's research was more general and far reaching because his lab also examined the role of bacteria in marine systems, with a particular focus on the role of bacteria in nutrient cycles, we are particularly interested in SOIL science and especially SOIL microbiology ... which is why we are still very much interested in the Seven Grand Questions that Waksman posed in his 1927 book, [***Principles of Soil Microbiology***](https://www.scribd.com/document/327671583/Principles-of-soil-microbiology-Waksman-Selman-A)
