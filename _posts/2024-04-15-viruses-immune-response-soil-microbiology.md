Remember where you were four years ago?

I bet a friend of mine 25c that the ***published*** [not *real*] USA death total, reportedly caused by [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) in the month of April 2020 would exceed 200,000 ... I picked that number since the death toll in October 1918, at the worst of the greatest influenenza pandemic ever was about 200,000 ... in other words, I believed that the number would have to be that high or else the momentum behind the COVID-19 fear-mongering campaign would lose steam and people would just move on ... I lost the bet; the COVID-19 deaths in April 2020 were not really close to being more than 200,000 ... 

But I REALLY LOST in a larger sense ***along with everyone else***, because I totally underestimated the [hypochondriasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypochondriasis) of affluent Americans ... I am not AT ALL saying that COVID-19 wasn't / isn't a real threat to human life -- it absolutely IS!  But the fear that was mongered from a susceptible population that legitimately should have been worried about their health ... but also have not remotely come to terms with their own mortality or the fact that we ALL die from something ... and that COVID-19 does not kill as many kids or young people, but hastens eventual death in the population of older and less healthy people who would probably EVENTUALLY [but within a few years, not immediately] die *sooner [within years], rather than later [within decades]* from some other viral attack or the common killers like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, etc.


# The COVID-19 Wikipedia Portal

As we might expect, the COVID-19 Wikipedia Portal is about selling vaccines and mongering the fear.

The information that is presented as if it is totally unbiased ... and "*must be the truth since I saw it on Wikipedia*" ... is a great way for those who are selling mRNA products as [COVID-19 vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine) to induce fear in a public that is already spooked about COVID-19 and the all of the variants. 

## NOTHING on Wikipedia is unbiased or TRUE; what's there is VERIFIABLE, ie can be checked against other sources, and the result of a lowest-common-denominator consensus of the editors who have the time and energy to edit a Wikipedia page.

The information on Wikipedia is great ... overall, Wikipedia is probably better than any other source of information on the internet that you want to name ... but Wikipedia is not the truth and it is not unbiased ... the information on Wikipedia is only VERIAFIABLE against questionable sources found elsewhere which deserve especially healthy skepticism [because of how Wikipedia-cited sources tend to used to make a questionable article more *sciencey*] AND Wikipedia information is a consensus of the lowest common denominator of the people who have the time and energy to edit a Wikipedia page. 

## SARS-CoV-2

As with every other person in the world, I probably have several variants of [SARS-CoV-2 virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2) in my body at this moment ... and AT THIS MOMENT, my immune system is fighting those virus variants off ... along with a bajillion other viruses, bacterias, fungi and other microorganisms that are probably not good for my health, fitness and longevity ... because, like most other people I kinda try to work having a relatively strong immune system AND at not exposing myself to too many different threats at once, ie I don't teach elementary school or hang out with kids in school *who are still learning not to lick one another* ... but that EVENTUALLY my immune system will fail. I can be sure of that.  I can also be sure of the fact that my immune system response WILL NOT get stronger because a so-called "vaccination" with a mRNA protein product that has a VERY NOTICEABLE EFFECT as it spurs the vax recipient's body to react against a simulated threat that has been engineered to be similar to an actual [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2) variant; the so-called "vaccine" is an mRNA engineered pharma product which triggers a DIFFERENT reaction to a DIFFERENT protein which is not from the actual virus ... the SIDE EFFECT of the so-called "vaccine" is very real, and even lethal for some people -- but the immunity is not an immune response to the REAL threat; moreover, it is quite apparent now that the immunity is not at all robust or long-lasting, ie all the better for those selling boosters to the so-called "vaccine".
